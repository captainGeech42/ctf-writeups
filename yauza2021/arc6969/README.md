# ARC6969 Part 1

(I didn't have time to work on part 2 this weekend since I had school work, so the emulator doesn't contain GPU support)

> The ARC6969 is an old and forgotten architecture used in a military computers during Cold War. Although we don't have the computers anymore, we got CPU manual and a few programs.

I made a Binary Ninja architecture plugin and an emulator for this. I solved it by converting the disassembly into Python and bruteforcing the 3 byte key to get the flag.
